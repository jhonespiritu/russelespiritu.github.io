My high school is okay, but not the best. There are some reasons for this, but I will not go into detail because it is too personal
Although it was not the best high school year, It was a lot of fun going places with my pals and hanging out and playing computer games
and I did well in school this year, not failing a single class. I pass them in class.<p>
