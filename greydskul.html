Now that I'm in my elemntary year, I'm having a lot of problems at school; I don't like going to school; when I was a youngster, the thing I liked to do was play. 
For me, my mother may become enraged every time I come home and play without even doing my homework, but it was not worth it. I have so many problems in school that I don't want to go,
yet I always find a way to graduate by doing my best.<p>
